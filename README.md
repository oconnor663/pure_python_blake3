# Pure Python BLAKE3 [![Actions Status](https://github.com/oconnor663/pure_python_blake3/workflows/tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/oconnor663/pure_python_blake3/actions)

This project is a pure Python implementations of the BLAKE3 cryptographic hash
function, a direct port of the [Rust reference
implementation](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/blob/master/reference_impl/reference_impl.rs).
This is intended for educational and testing use only. It's too slow for
production use, and it has not been audited.
